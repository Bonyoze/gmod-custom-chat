### âš  A major refactor was implemented recently.

Heres some of the more notable changes:

- Moved and renamed files, now using more appropriate names
- Replaced all references of `SChat` with `CustomChat`
- Made functions from the `CustomChat` global table use `:` only when necessary
- Implemented new data save formats, save data to a separate folder
- Written a data migration script
- Use a dedicated library to synchonize server theme/emojis/tags across clients
- Made the chat history panel able to be used separately
- Store emojis in a more readable format
- Vastly faster way to access emoji properties
- Moved the main chat interface to a separate vgui panel
- Made the right-click menu options work independently (so now it can show both "Copy text..." and "Copy link...", for example)
- Theme editor overhaul & the ability to save multiple themes
- All text is stored in language files now

### Text Formatting Options

```
||Spoilers here||
*Italic text here*
**Bold text here**
***Bold & Italic text here***
$$rainbow text here$$
`line of code here`
{{block of code here}}
```block of code here```
[[Marquee-like advert here]]
[Link text Here](https://link-url-here.org)
<255,0,0>Red text here, and <0,0,255>blue text here
```

### Fonts

You can change the font by typing **;fontname;** before the text.
_(A list of fonts can be found on the workshop page.)_

```;comic; This will be displayed as Comic Sans```

### Whitelisted Sites

By default, the chat box will only load pictures from trusted websites. You can open a pull request to add more, or send a request [here](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2799307109/3272437487156558008/).

### For developers

You can prevent links from certain players from embedding, by using the `CanEmbedCustomChat` hook on the **clientside**.

```lua
hook.Add( "CanEmbedCustomChat", "override_chat_embed_access", function( ply, url, urlType )
    -- return false to block embeds from "url"

    -- "urlType" will be one of these strings:
    -- "image", "audio", and "url" for other stuff

    -- example: only allow super admins to use embeds
    if not ply:IsSuperAdmin() then return false end

    -- example: prevent audio from embedding for everyone
    if urlType == "audio" then return false end
end )
```
